# Tasks
## TODO
- Implement command history: F3 copies previous command. Support unix style history with arrow keys up and down to scroll through previous
    - Implement previous history browsing by writing the beginning of the line and then selecting with arrows history-lines, which matches the beginning of the line that user 
- Implement command line argument support (%1, %2, %3, etc.)
- Implement SETLOCAL and ENDLOCAL commands for local variable scoping
- Implement IF/ELSE statement support
- Implement nested IF statements
- Implement comparison operators (EQU, NEQ, LSS, LEQ, GTR, GEQ)
- Implement logical operators (AND, OR, NOT)
- Implement arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %) with SET /A
- Implement assignment operators (+=, -=, *=, /=, %=)
- Implement bitwise operators (&, |, ^)
- Implement REM/:: comment functionality
- Implement GOTO and label functionality for functions
- Implement CALL command to call functions
- Implement EXIT /B for function returns
- Implement FOR loop functionality
- Implement redirection operators (>, >>, <, 2>, 2>&1)
- Implement pipe operator (|)
- Implement more file commands: COPY, DEL, MD, RD, REN, MOVE, TYPE, DIR
- Implement date/time commands: DATE, TIME
- Implement MORE, SORT, FIND commands
- Implement CHOICE command for user input options
- Implement START, TITLE commands
- Implement ATTRIB, VOL, LABEL commands
- Implement system information commands: SYSTEMINFO, VER
- Implement network commands: PING, IPCONFIG, NET
- Implement process commands: TASKLIST, TASKKILL
- Implement SUBST command for drive substitution
- Implement tree and other directory commands: TREE, XCOPY
- Implement PATH command
- Implement PROMPT command
- Implement file comparison: FC, COMP
- Implement disk commands: CHKDSK, FORMAT, DISKPART
- Implement error handling and exit codes
- Implement additional input/output features
- Add support for numeric variables with SET /A
- Implement SHIFT operator for command line arguments beyond %9
- Implement string manipulation functions
- Implement file I/O operations (reading, writing, appending files)
- Implement conditional file operations
- Add comprehensive error checking and reporting

## DONE
- created initial README.md
- write to shell md files
    - shell will default to "\\" directory separator, but supports "/"
    - linux root directory "/" binds to "C:\\"
    - other directories can be mount with internal MOUNT command (like in DOS?)
    - "%OS%" environment value is real like uname in linux, but it can be overriden with program params and internal commands to e.g. "Windows_NT"
- create a small web scraper, which downloads tutorial web pages from "https://www.tutorialspoint.com/batch_script/index.htm" and all pages starting with "https://www.tutorialspoint.com/batch_script/" to "shell/docs/www"
    - basically you find the next button at '<div class="button " id="btn_top_next">' and follow that link until there's no next button
    - download all images to "shell/docs/www" too
    - convert those web pages to markdown in "shell/docs" and move used images to "shell/docs/imgs". Only convert the main text information.
- Implemented basic shell with echo, set, cd, pwd, cls, pause commands
- Implemented batch file execution support
- Implemented @echo off functionality
- Implemented environment variable expansion (%VAR%)
- Implemented path conversion between Windows and Linux formats
- Implemented directory mounting capabilities
- change #define "v1.0" to be latest
- CLI should feel like Windows Command Prompt or cmd in Wine. Default prompt in directory "C:\Users\sblo" is: "C:\Users\sblo>"
- add "-h" and "--help" support for main program
- add "help" command upport in the CLI command loop
- use md files in docs directory to create implementation stub of the shell program in C (COMPLETED)
