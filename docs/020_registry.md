The Registry is one of the key elements on a windows system. It contains a lot of information on various aspects of the operating system. Almost all applications installed on a windows system interact with the registry in some form or the other.

The Registry contains two basic elements: keys and values. **Registry keys** are container objects similar to folders. **Registry values** are non-container objects similar to files. Keys may contain values or further keys. Keys are referenced with a syntax similar to Windows' path names, using backslashes to indicate levels of hierarchy.

This chapter looks at various functions such as querying values, adding, deleting and editing values from the registry.
