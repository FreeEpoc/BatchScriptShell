## Batch Script Tutorial

Batch Scripts are stored in simple text files containing lines with commands that get executed in sequence, one after the other. Scripting is a way by which one can alleviate this necessity by automating these command sequences in order to make ones life at the shell easier and more productive. This tutorial discusses the basic functionalities of Batch Script along with relevant examples for easy understanding.
